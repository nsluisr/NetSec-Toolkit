A suite of command-line tools written in Python for performing network security audits. It includes a deep network scanner and a traffic monitor with Man-in-the-Middle (ARP Spoofing) capabilities.

**Developed and optimized by sluisr.**

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Network Discovery:** Scans the local network to find all active hosts.
- ✅ **Deep Analysis:** Performs a detailed port and service scan on a specific target using Nmap.
- ✅ **Traffic Monitoring:** Captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time.
- ✅ **Service Identification:** Detects connections to popular services (Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.).
- ✅ **Network Visualization:** Generates a graphical map of connections between devices and external services.
- ✅ **Polished User Interface:** Interactive CLI with colors and animations for a better user experience.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.9+**
2.  **Python Dependencies:** Listed in `requirements.txt`.
3.  **System Tools:**

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nsluisr/NetSec-Toolkit.git
    cd NetSec-Toolkit
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install system tools:**
    - **On Arch Linux:**
      ```bash
      sudo pacman -S nmap tshark dsniff graphviz
      ```
    - **On Debian/Ubuntu:**
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install nmap tshark dsniff graphviz
      ```

## USAGE

Both scripts should be run from the project's root directory.

### Deep Scanner

This script can be run with normal user privileges for basic scanning, but requires `sudo` for Nmap scans.

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment if you haven't already
_source venv/bin/activate_

# Run the script
sudo python3 deep_scanner.py
```

### Enhanced Monitor

This script **requires superuser privileges** to perform ARP spoofing and to put the network card in promiscuous mode. **You must run it with the Python interpreter from the virtual environment**.

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated

# Run the script with sudo and the venv's python
sudo venv/bin/python3 enhanced_monitor.py
```
